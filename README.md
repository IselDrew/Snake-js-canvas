# Retro Snake Game

This is an old fashioned snake game made with JavaScript and CanvasHTML. In latest versions I've tried to implement OOP style instead of functional style.

## Getting started

Clone repository:

`git clone https://github.com/IselDrew/Snake-js-canvas.git`

Open index.html with your browser.
